- [ ] Add basic error handling
- [ ] Implement user notifications system

### Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Perform thorough manual testing of all implemented features

- [ ] Deploy the application to Replit
- [ ] Conduct final tests in the deployed environment

## Post-MVP Tasks (if time allows)
- [ ] Implement basic unit tests
- [ ] Enhance error logging on the server side
- [ ] Optimize performance for larger datasets
- [ ] Improve UI/UX based on initial usage

**Note:** Prioritize core functionality over additional features. Focus on reliability and usability for the initial release. Document any known issues or limitations for future iterations.
