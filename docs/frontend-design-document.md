# Custom Map Application - Frontend Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the frontend design for the Custom Map Application, focusing on the layout, user interface (UI), user experience (UX), and the technologies that will be used. The primary goal is to create a responsive, interactive, and visually appealing map-based application that functions seamlessly on desktop and laptop browsers.

## UI Design and Layout

### Layout Overview

- **Main Map Area**: The application opens with a full-screen map of the United States, centered within the browser window. This map is the primary focus of the application.
- **Top Toolbar**: A toolbar located at the top of the window provides various controls and functions, such as color selection, reset, clear, zoom controls, and export options.
- **Color Palette**: Positioned in the top left corner, the color palette allows users to select colors for highlighting counties on the map.

### Interactivity

- **Zooming and Panning**: Users can zoom in and out of the map using zoom controls on the toolbar. Panning is allowed by dragging the map area.
- **County Selection**: Users can click on individual counties to change their color based on the selected palette. Counties can be deselected by clicking them again or using the clear/reset functions.

### Tools and Controls

- **Color Picker**: Users can choose from a predefined set of colors or select a custom color for highlighting counties.
- **Clear and Reset Buttons**: The clear button removes the color from selected counties, while the reset button restores the map to its original state.
- **Zoom Controls**: These allow users to zoom in and out of the map.
- **Export Options**: Users can export the map as an image or export the data as a JSON file.

## Color Scheme and Themes

### Light and Dark Modes

- **Default to Light Mode**: The application will initially load in light mode.
- **User Selection**: Users can toggle between light and dark modes according to their preference.

### Branding

- **No Initial Branding**: The application will not include any branding elements in the initial version.

## Interactive Features

### County Interaction

- **Clicking on Counties**: Clicking a county changes its color, and clicking again deselects it.
- **Right-Click for Information**: Right-clicking on a county opens a modal with detailed information retrieved from external APIs.

### Smooth Transitions

- **Visual Effects**: Smooth transitions will be applied to all interactive elements, including color changes, modals, and tooltips.

### Additional Tools

- **No Additional Tools in V1**: The first version will focus solely on the core functionalities mentioned above.

## Responsive Design

### Target Devices

- **Desktop and Laptop Only**: The application is designed for use on desktop and laptop browsers.
- **No Mobile Support**: Mobile support will not be included in v1. However, the application will be functional on tablets with larger screen sizes (e.g., iPads).

### Breakpoints

- **Optimized for Larger Screens**: The layout will be responsive but primarily optimized for larger screens. Specific breakpoints will ensure the UI adapts to different desktop screen sizes.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Flow

- **Primary Interaction**: The main user flow involves selecting counties, changing their colors, and exporting the map as an image or JSON.
- **Map State Saving**: Users can save map states locally in their browser’s local storage. This allows them to return to their saved state in future sessions.
- **Drag and Select**: Users can hold down `cmd` (Mac) or `ctrl` (Windows) and drag the mouse across the map to select multiple counties without clicking.

### Feedback Mechanisms

- **Tooltips**: 
  - When hovering over a county, a tooltip will display the county name and state.
  - Tooltips will also be provided for toolbar functions to guide users.
- **Modals**: Detailed county data will be shown in a modal when users right-click on a county.
- **Notifications**: Processing notifications will appear when tasks require time, such as exporting data.
- **Progress Indicators**: Longer tasks, like exporting images or data, will display progress bars or indicators.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Supported Shortcuts

- **County Selection**: Users can hold down `cmd` (Mac) or `ctrl` (Windows) and drag the mouse across the map to quickly select multiple counties.

### Customization

- **No Additional Shortcuts**: v1 will not include other keyboard shortcuts or customization options.

## Error Handling

### Error Display

- **Notification System**: Error messages will be displayed as notifications that slide down from the top of the page. 
- **Unrecoverable Errors**: If an error is unrecoverable, the application will send information to the server, which will be linked to the admin dashboard and notify the admin.

### User Recovery

- **Retry Options**: For recoverable errors, users will have the option to retry the failed operation or be guided on how to proceed.

## Performance Optimization

### Loading and Caching

- **Frontend Caching**: All county data will be cached on the frontend to ensure quick loading and responsiveness.
- **Optimized Loading**: The application will use strategies like lazy loading and minimizing third-party scripts to enhance performance.

### Performance Goals

- **General Focus**: While specific performance metrics are not a priority, the application should be as quick and responsive as possible.

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security

- **Input Sanitization**: Ensure that all user inputs are sanitized to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Basic Security Measures**: Although there is no sensitive data, standard security practices like HTTPS and secure handling of user inputs will be implemented.

## Version Control and Deployment

### Version Control

- **Git and GitHub**: The frontend code will be managed using Git, with repositories hosted on GitHub.

### Deployment Strategy

- **Replit Deployment**: The frontend will be deployed through Replit, integrated with the backend deployment process.

## Third-Party Integrations

### Map and Data Libraries

- **Initial Request**: All necessary libraries, including map information and Tailwind CSS, will be served with the initial application load.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: The application will use Tailwind CSS for styling and avoid additional UI libraries to keep the frontend lightweight.

## State Management

### Pinia for State Management

- **Centralized State**: Pinia will manage the application’s state, including user selections, map data, and UI settings.
- **Local Storage**: Users’ map states will be saved to their browser’s local storage, allowing them to restore their session state between visits.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit and End-to-End Testing**: A comprehensive testing strategy will include both unit tests for individual components and end-to-end tests for the entire user flow.
- **Deferred to Expert Opinion**: The specific tools and frameworks for testing (e.g., Jest, Cypress) will be selected based on best practices and suitability for the project.

### Cross-Browser Compatibility

- **Supported Browsers**: The application will be tested on all major modern browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- **Older Browsers**: Compatibility with older browser versions is not a priority for v1.
