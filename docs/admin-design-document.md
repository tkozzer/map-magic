- **Use Case**: Quickly identify and diagnose issues affecting the application, with the ability to prioritize critical errors.

### 4. User Interaction Monitoring

- **Endpoint**: `GET /admin/stats/user-interactions`
- **Description**: Tracks user interactions on the site, such as the number of counties clicked, maps generated, JSON files exported, and images created.
- **Response**: JSON object with interaction metrics, broken down by user actions.
- **Use Case**: Understand how users are interacting with the application, which features are most popular, and where users may be encountering difficulties.

### 5. Rate Limiting Monitoring

- **Endpoint**: `GET /admin/stats/rate-limiting`
- **Description**: Monitors rate limiting across the application, showing how many times rate limits have been hit and which IPs or users are most affected.
- **Response**: JSON object with rate limit data, including IP addresses, endpoints affected, and timestamps.
- **Use Case**: Ensure that rate limits are correctly implemented and not overly restrictive. Identify potential abuse or need for rate limit adjustments.

### 6. System Health Check

- **Endpoint**: `GET /admin/health`
- **Description**: Provides a real-time snapshot of the systemâ€™s health, including server status, database connectivity, and external API availability.
- **Response**: JSON object indicating the status of various components (e.g., OK, WARNING, CRITICAL) and additional details if something is not functioning properly.
- **Use Case**: Quickly assess the overall health of the application and pinpoint areas that may need attention or immediate action.

### 7. Cache Management

- **Endpoint**: `POST /admin/cache/clear`
- **Description**: Clears the server cache, either entirely or for specific keys, allowing the admin to reset the cache when necessary.
- **Request Body**: Optionally specify keys or data types to clear.
- **Response**: JSON object indicating success or failure.
- **Use Case**: Manually clear outdated or incorrect cache entries, especially after a bug fix or data update.

### 8. Configuration and Control

- **Endpoint**: `GET /admin/config`
- **Description**: Retrieves the current configuration settings for the backend, including environment variables, rate limits, and caching strategies.
- **Response**: JSON object with current configuration settings.
- **Use Case**: Review the configuration settings currently in effect, ensuring they match the intended deployment.

- **Endpoint**: `POST /admin/config`
- **Description**: Allows updating certain configuration settings on the fly, such as adjusting rate limits, TTL for caches, or enabling/disabling specific features.
- **Request Body**: JSON object with the new configuration values.
- **Response**: JSON object indicating success or failure.
- **Use Case**: Make adjustments to the backend without needing to redeploy, useful for quick fixes or performance tuning.

### 9. Session and Traffic Monitoring

- **Endpoint**: `GET /admin/stats/sessions`
- **Description**: Provides information on active sessions, including IP addresses, session durations, and the number of requests made per session.
- **Response**: JSON object with session details.
- **Use Case**: Monitor current user traffic, detect any unusual patterns, and ensure the application is handling sessions effectively.

### 10. Audit Logs

- **Endpoint**: `GET /admin/audit-logs`
- **Description**: Retrieves logs of significant actions taken on the server, such as changes to configuration, cache clears, or admin actions.
- **Response**: JSON array of audit logs, with details such as action, user (if applicable), timestamp, and result.
- **Use Case**: Maintain a record of critical actions performed on the backend, useful for troubleshooting and accountability.

### 11. Admin Authentication

- **Endpoint**: `POST /admin/login`
- **Description**: Endpoint for admin authentication. Requires an admin username and password (or OAuth if implemented).
- **Request Body**: JSON object with `username` and `password`.
- **Response**: JSON object with a session token for authenticated requests.
- **Use Case**: Secure access to the admin endpoints, ensuring that only authorized users can monitor or control the application.

## Security and Authentication

### Authentication

- **Admin Login**: Admins will authenticate using a username and password via the `/admin/login` endpoint. Upon successful authentication, a session token will be issued and required for subsequent admin actions.
- **Token Management**: Tokens will have an expiration time (e.g., 1 hour) and can be refreshed. Tokens will be stored securely on the server.

### Access Control

- **Role-Based Access**: In the future, consider implementing role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate between different levels of admin privileges (e.g., read-only vs. full control).
- **IP Whitelisting**: Optionally restrict access to admin endpoints to specific IP addresses or ranges.

### Rate Limiting

- **Admin Endpoints**: Implement rate limiting on admin endpoints to prevent abuse or brute-force attacks on the login system.

## Error Handling and Logging

### Centralized Error Handling

- **Global Error Handler**: A centralized error handler will manage errors across all admin endpoints, ensuring consistent error responses.
- **Error Codes**: Use standardized error codes to indicate the type of error (e.g., `401 Unauthorized`, `500 Internal Server Error`).

### Logging

- **Admin Actions**: All actions taken via the admin API will be logged, including the action performed, the admin user, and the timestamp.
- **Error Logs**: Errors encountered in the admin system will be logged with full details, including stack traces for debugging.

## Future Considerations

### Enhanced Monitoring

- **Real-Time Analytics**: Consider adding real-time analytics to the admin dashboard to monitor user interactions and API performance live.
- **Alerting System**: Integrate with a notification system (e.g., Slack, email) to alert admins of critical issues like high error rates or system downtime.

### Admin Dashboard

- **UI Development**: The admin endpoints will be connected to an admin dashboard, providing a graphical interface for monitoring and control. This can be built using Vue.js or another frontend framework.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **User Roles**: Implement roles such as `superadmin`, `admin`, and `viewer` to provide varying levels of access and control within the admin system.

## Monitoring and Analytics for Admin

### Logging

- **Request Logs**: Log all incoming admin requests, including metadata like timestamps, IP addresses, and actions performed.
- **Error Logs**: Log all errors encountered in the admin system, including stack traces for debugging purposes.

### Monitoring

- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the performance of admin endpoints, ensuring they respond quickly and do not become a bottleneck.
- **Security Monitoring**: Track failed login attempts and other potential security incidents in the admin system.

## Deployment on Replit

### Admin Environment

- **Project Structure**: Ensure that admin-related code and configuration are separated from the main application code, using environment variables for sensitive data like admin credentials.
- **Environment Variables**: Store admin credentials and other sensitive information securely in Replit's environment variables.

For general deployment information, refer to the [Deployment and Hosting](technology-stack.md#4-deployment-and-hosting) section in the Technology Stack document.

### Deployment Process

- **Automatic Deployment**: Replit supports automatic deployment when changes are pushed to the repository or made directly in the Replit editor.
- **Testing**: Use Replit's built-in console and logs to test and debug the admin system before and after deployment.
