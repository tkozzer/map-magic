# Two-Day MVP Development Plan for Custom Map Application

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for developing and deploying a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of the Custom Map Application within a two-day timeframe. The focus is on implementing core functionalities and ensuring a working product is deployed to Replit.

## Day 1: Setup and Core Development

### Morning: Environment Setup and Initial Development
1. Set up the development environment:
   - Install Node.js, Vue.js, and necessary dependencies
   - Create a new Replit project and configure it for the application
2. Backend setup:
   - Create a basic Express server
   - Implement endpoints for county data retrieval
   - Set up a simple caching mechanism (in-memory or Redis) for Wikidata API requests

### Afternoon: Frontend Development
3. Create the Vue.js application structure
4. Port the core map rendering logic from the PoC to a Vue.js component
5. Implement the color picker functionality
6. Create a basic UI layout using Tailwind CSS

## Day 2: Feature Completion and Deployment

### Morning: Feature Implementation
7. Complete the county selection and coloring functionality
8. Implement the image export feature
9. Add basic error handling and user notifications

### Afternoon: Testing and Deployment
10. Perform thorough manual testing of all implemented features
11. Fix any critical bugs discovered during testing
12. Deploy the application to Replit
13. Conduct final tests in the deployed environment

## Post-MVP Tasks (if time allows)
- Implement basic unit tests
- Enhance error logging on the server side
- Optimize performance for larger datasets
- Improve UI/UX based on initial usage

## Notes
- Prioritize core functionality over additional features
- Focus on reliability and usability for the initial release
- Document any known issues or limitations for future iterations
