## 1. Programming Languages

### Node.js
- **Rationale**: Node.js will be used for both the frontend and backend, ensuring a consistent JavaScript-based environment across the entire application stack.
- **Benefits**: Unified development experience, large ecosystem, and community support.

## 2. Frontend Frameworks and Libraries

### Vue.js (Latest Version)
- **Rationale**: Vue.js will be used for the frontend, leveraging the latest version with the Composition API.
- **Benefits**: Modern features, reactivity, component-based architecture, and strong community support.

### Tailwind CSS (Latest Version)
- **Rationale**: Tailwind CSS will be used for styling the frontend.
- **Benefits**: Utility-first CSS framework that offers flexibility and efficiency in design.

### Pinia (Latest Version)
- **Rationale**: Pinia will be used for state management within the Vue.js application.
- **Benefits**: Modern, intuitive, and compatible with the Vue 3 Composition API.

## 3. Backend Frameworks and Tools

### Express Framework
- **Rationale**: The Express framework will be used to build the backend APIs.
- **Benefits**: Lightweight, flexible, and widely used in the Node.js ecosystem.

For a detailed breakdown of the API endpoints, refer to the [API Structure and Endpoints](backend-design-document.md#api-structure-and-endpoints) section in the Backend Design Document.

### PostgreSQL (Admin Database)
- **Rationale**: PostgreSQL will be used as the database for the admin system, handling secure login and other admin-specific data.
- **Benefits**: Robust, secure, and widely supported relational database system.

### Caching Solution (Recommended)
- **Recommendation**: **Redis** will be used as the caching solution.
  - **Rationale**: Redis is a powerful, in-memory data structure store that supports scaling and can handle high-throughput operations.
  - **Benefits**: Fast, supports a variety of data structures, and is well-suited for caching frequently accessed data, reducing load on the server.

## 4. Deployment and Hosting

### Replit
- **Rationale**: Replit will be used for deploying the application due to its ease of use and cost-effectiveness.
- **Benefits**: Integrated development environment, simple deployment process, and built-in scaling capabilities.

### GitHub Actions
- **Rationale**: GitHub Actions will be used for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
- **Benefits**: Seamless integration with GitHub repositories, customizable workflows, and automation of testing, building, and deployment processes.

## 5. APIs and Integrations

### Wikidata API
- **Rationale**: Wikidata will be the primary external API used to retrieve data about counties.
- **Usage**: Retrieve metadata such as population, area, and coordinates for counties.

### Nominatim OpenStreetMap API
- **Rationale**: Nominatim OpenStreetMap API will be used to retrieve polygon data for counties.
- **Usage**: Fetch geographic boundaries for counties to be displayed on the map.

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

### Testing Frameworks (Recommended)
- **Recommendation**: **Jest** for unit testing and **Cypress** for end-to-end testing.
  - **Jest**: Comprehensive testing framework with built-in mocking, assertions, and coverage reporting.
  - **Cypress**: End-to-end testing tool that provides fast, reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser.
- **Rationale**: Jest and Cypress are both widely adopted and offer excellent integration with Node.js and Vue.js applications.
- **Benefits**: Ensures code quality, reliability, and helps catch bugs early in the development process.

### Linting and Formatting
- **Tool**: **ESLint** and **Prettier** (configured within the Cursor editor).
- **Rationale**: These tools ensure consistent code style and help prevent common errors.
- **Benefits**: Maintains code quality and readability across the project.

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

### Monitoring and Logging Solutions (Recommended)
- **Recommendation**: **Sentry** for error tracking and **Loggly** or **Papertrail** for log management.
  - **Sentry**: Provides real-time error tracking and performance monitoring.
  - **Loggly/Papertrail**: Cloud-based log management services that offer easy search and analysis of logs.
- **Rationale**: These tools will provide comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities, ensuring that issues can be quickly identified and addressed.
- **Benefits**: Helps maintain application health, provides insights into user behavior, and assists in debugging.

## 8. Scalability and Performance

### Scaling Strategy
- **Approach**: Rely on Replit's built-in scaling capabilities for handling increased traffic and user load.
- **Rationale**: Replit offers simple scaling options, which should be sufficient for the initial deployment.
- **Future Consideration**: Monitor performance and scale horizontally if necessary by distributing the application across multiple Replit instances.

### Caching Strategy
- **Tool**: **Redis** (as mentioned in the Caching Solution section).
- **Rationale**: Redis will handle caching of frequently accessed data to improve response times and reduce server load.
- **Benefits**: Enhances performance, particularly under high traffic conditions.

## 9. Security

### HTTPS and JWTs
- **HTTPS**: Enforce HTTPS across the application to secure data in transit.
- **JWTs**: Use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for securing admin APIs.
- **Rationale**: These measures will protect sensitive data and ensure secure communication between the client and server.

For more information on admin authentication and security, see the [Security and Authentication](admin-design-document.md#security-and-authentication) section in the Admin Design Document.

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on APIs to prevent abuse.
- **IP Whitelisting/Blacklisting**: Restrict access to sensitive endpoints by whitelisting trusted IP addresses and blacklisting malicious ones.
- **Rationale**: Protects the application from malicious activities and ensures only authorized users can access admin functionalities.

## 10. Future Considerations

### OAuth Authentication
- **Rationale**: While v1 will not include user authentication, OAuth will be considered for future versions to manage user accounts and secure the application.
- **Benefits**: Provides a standardized and secure way to authenticate users, enhancing the security and usability of the application.
